# Credit-Risk-Classification


The data analysis project involves using Python modules, such as NumPy, Pandas, and scikit-learn, to create a logistic regression model for predicting loan statuses. The analysis includes splitting the data into training and testing sets, evaluating model performance with original data, and then using resampled data for better accuracy. The results show improved model performance after resampling, achieving 99% accuracy and 84% precision in identifying high-risk loans.
